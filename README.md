# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

<h1 style="color: #333;">React.js & Firebase CRUD Operations</h1>

<p>This repository contains a learning project focused on performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using React.js and Firebase. Developed as part of Learn4Skills training, this project is a hands-on demonstration of full-stack application capabilities in React and Firebase, guided by Rai Ammar, CEO of Learn4Skills.</p>

<h2 style="color: #555; margin-top: 30px;">🚀 About the Project</h2>
<p>This project is a simple, interactive CRUD application built with <strong>React.js</strong> for the frontend and <strong>Firebase</strong> for backend data management. The purpose is to help beginners and enthusiasts understand how to integrate Firebase Firestore with React, covering essential concepts such as data management, authentication, and cloud storage.</p>

<h2 style="color: #555; margin-top: 30px;">🔥 Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Create</strong>: Add new items to the Firebase database.</li>
    <li><strong>Read</strong>: Retrieve and display data from Firebase.</li>
    <li><strong>Update</strong>: Edit existing data in real-time.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete</strong>: Remove data from Firebase.</li>
    <li><strong>Authentication</strong>: Manage user sessions securely with Firebase Authentication.</li>
</ul>
